<h1>Scoring risks based on their likelihood and severity</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved scoring risks associated with a bank's operational environment, located in a coastal area with low crime rates. The risk register included assets such as funds, user databases, financial records, and more. Risks were evaluated based on likelihood and severity, creating a priority score for addressing each risk. For example, the risk of business email compromise was scored at a moderate likelihood and moderate severity, leading to a priority score of 4. Other risks included compromised user databases, financial record leaks, theft, and supply chain disruption, each scored and prioritized accordingly. The project aimed to identify vulnerabilities, assess potential impacts, and recommend measures for mitigation to ensure the bank's data and funds remain secure.
